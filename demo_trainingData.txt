case-report,100000,Carcinoma Showing Thymus-Like Differentiation (CASTLE): Cytopathological Features and Differential Diagnosis Carcinoma Showing Thymus-Like Differentiation (CASTLE): Cytopathological Features and Differential Diagnosis Background: CASTLE (carcinoma showing thymus-like differentiation) is a rare tumor (accounting for less than 0.15% of thyroid neoplasms) with most of the reported cases from Asia. Although this tumor is rare, distinguishing it from more aggressive neoplasms is critical because of its improved prognosis. To date, there have been limited studies on its cytomorphological features. Herein, we review the cytomorphological features of 10 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cases of histologically confirmed CASTLE and discuss the findings in light of the current literature. Methods: We retrospectively (1989-2016) identified 10 cases of CASTLE from 17,415 surgical cases of thyroid carcinoma from The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The cases were reviewed for discrete cytomorphological characteristics. Results: All of the cases displayed predominantly single (dishesive) epithelial cell populations, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios, hyperchromatic to open/vesicular nuclei and macronucleoli. The majority of cases additionally showed hypercellular, three-dimensional fragments in a background of lymphocytes. The fragments displayed syncytial architecture without molding and rarely squamous differentiation. All cases lacked follicular differentiation, intranuclear inclusions, nuclear molding, or neuroendocrine-type chromatin. Conclusions: Cytopathological features alone do not appear to be distinctive or definitive of CASTLE but rather allow for the inclusion of CASTLE within the differential diagnosis. Procurement of cell block material is important and resulted in the single case of CASTLE accurately diagnosed on FNA. Cytopathological features that favored CASTLE included syncytial fragments of malignant cells with pleomorphic large nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli in a background of lymphocytes. These cytopathological findings in the appropriate clinicoradiological context warrant its inclusion in the reported differential diagnosis in order to be able to implement appropriate clinical management.,,,,
case-report,100001,Cytomorphology and Histology Correlation of Rosai-Dorfman Disease: A 15-Year Study from a Tertiary Referral Centre in South India Cytomorphology and Histology Correlation of Rosai-Dorfman Disease: A 15-Year Study from a Tertiary Referral Centre in South India Objectives: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is an uncommon, benign histiocytic disorder of unknown etiology, typically presenting in young adulthood. We highlight the cytomorphology of RDD and correlate it with the histopathology. Study Design: All cases diagnosed as RDD on fine-needle aspiration cytology between January 2001 and June 2015 were included. Clinical details were obtained from medical records. The cytology smears were reviewed along with the histopathology and immunohistochemistry, wherever available. Results: The study included 10 cases ranging in age from 11 to 68 years (median 29). There was a male predominance with a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. The patients commonly presented with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Extranodal involvement was seen in 2 cases in the nose and mandible, respectively. Of these 10 cases, 8 were later biopsied. The cytological features included numerous crescentic histiocytes, emperipolesis, reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells. A histological diagnosis of RDD was made in 7 out of 8 cases, and 1 was diagnosed as Hodgkin lymphoma. Conclusion: FNA represents an efficient, minimally invasive, cost-effective and reliable technique for the diagnosis of RDD and may obviate the need for further biopsy. However, the disease has close differential diagnoses, including Langerhans cell histiocytosis, granulomatous lesions, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Hence, it must be remembered that there can be pitfalls when the diagnosis is made by cytology alone.,
meta-analysis,100002,Impact of the Reclassification of the Non-Invasive Follicular Variant of Papillary Carcinoma as Benign on the Malignancy Risk of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology: A Meta-Analysis Study Impact of the Reclassification of the Non-Invasive Follicular Variant of Papillary Carcinoma as Benign on the Malignancy Risk of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology: A Meta-Analysis Study Objectives: The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) established diagnostic categories for cytologic specimens of the thyroid. Each category was associated with an estimated risk of malignancy. Recently, the non-invasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma has been reclassified as benign. This reclassification may alter the malignancy risk of TBSRTC diagnostic categories. Study Design: A literature search was made for all studies investigating the effect of reclassification of some non-invasive follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinomas as benign on the malignancy risk associated with TBSRTC categories. The authors calculated the malignancy risk for TBSRTC categories in a series of 315 thyroid aspirates when the non-invasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma was considered benign. A meta-analysis of malignancy risk data for the 3 published studies and the current study was performed. Results: The meta-analysis showed that the malignancy risk was reduced for all TBSRTC categories except the “non-diagnostic” category. The reduction in malignancy risk was greatest in the categories “suspicious for malignancy” and “atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance.” Conclusion: A meta-analysis of all pertinent studies demonstrated that re-categorization of the non-invasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma as benign reduces the malignancy risk in the majority of TBSRTC categories.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
review-article,100003,Clinical Utility of Endometrial Cell Block Cytology in Postmenopausal Women Clinical Utility of Endometrial Cell Block Cytology in Postmenopausal Women Objective: To investigate the diagnostic utility of endometrial (EM) cell block (CB) cytology for the detection of intrauterine malignancy in postmenopausal women. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 104 postmenopausal women between January 2012 and November 2014. We reviewed symptoms upon admission, body mass index, parity, transvaginal ultrasonographic findings, and histopathological results based on CB and conventional cytology. Results: The mean age was 62.6 (range 48-95) years. The mean menopausal age was 50.8 years and the mean duration of menopause was 12.0 years. The sensitivity of CB and conventional cytology was 82.3% (29/35) and 85.7% (30/35) and the specificity was 98.6% (68/69) and 94.2% (65/69), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CB cytology combined with conventional cytology were 82.3% (29/35) and 94.2% (65/69), respectively. The predictive values for EM hyperplasia and type-II carcinoma were 100 and 85.7%, respectively. Conclusion: CB cytology provides specimens for examination in a single outpatient session. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining can provide useful information for histological diagnosis. A combination of CB and conventional cytology can improve the diagnostic accuracy of EM lesions and may be a valid method for screening in postmenopausal women.,,,,,,,,
case-report,100004,"Glandular Cell Abnormalities on SurePath Preparations: A Retrospective Review with Cytology-Histology Correlations Glandular Cell Abnormalities on SurePath Preparations: A Retrospective Review with Cytology-Histology Correlations Objective: Detecting glandular lesions is challenging by all Pap test methodologies. As the availability of data on identifying glandular abnormalities by SurePath is scarce, we investigated the detection rates and the correlation with histology follow-up. Study Design: A total of 105,927 cases (SurePath and conventional) were searched for the diagnosis of atypical glandular cells or higher glandular abnormalities (AGC+) with the corresponding histologic diagnosis. The associations between the Pap test methods and diagnostic categories were assessed by χ2 test. Results: Overall, 0.32% of SurePath (159/49,375) and 0.29% of conventional (164/56,552) cases showed AGC+ (p = 0.38). Histology confirmed significant abnormalities in 42 versus 53.5% of the cases, respectively (p = 0.064); 72.7% (SurePath) versus 65.2% (conventional) of these were glandular in nature (p = 0.37). The diagnosis of neoplasia (favored or definitive) showed malignancy on follow-up in 100% of SurePath cases (12/12). In contrast, 82.1% of these conventional cases disclosed premalignant or malignant lesions by histology (p = 0.12). Conclusions: AGC+ cases showed higher prevalence on SurePath preparations. Conventional cases had more abnormalities on follow-up, while glandular lesions represented a higher proportion of abnormal histologies following SurePath AGC+s. The positive predictive value of favored or definite neoplasia was higher in SurePath cases. Overall, these differences were not statistically significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
case-report,100005,Cytopathology of Solid Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Differential Diagnoses with other Thyroid Tumors Cytopathology of Solid Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Differential Diagnoses with other Thyroid Tumors Objectives: Solid variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (SVPTC) is rare, differing from classical PTC (cPTC) in architecture and outcome. We evaluated the cytomorphology of SVPTC cases to assess the feasibility of a preoperative diagnosis. Study Design: SVPTC cases were evaluated for architecture, nuclear features, and Bethesda category and were compared with noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features/follicular variant of PTC (NIFTP/FVPTC), cPTC, and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). Results: Nine SVPTCs, 29 NIFTP/FVPTCs, 12 cPTCs, and 4 PDTCs were included. The predominant architecture in most SVPTCs was solid fragment, which is helpful in differentiating them from NIFTP/FVPTC (p &,,,,,,,
research-article,100006,"Specific Binding of Paraprotein to Platelet Receptors as a Cause of Platelet Dysfunction in Monoclonal Gammopathies Specific Binding of Paraprotein to Platelet Receptors as a Cause of Platelet Dysfunction in Monoclonal Gammopathies The study included 48 untreated patients with monoclonal gammopathies (MG). Paraprotein was isolated from the serum of 10 patients with decreased platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation was measured before and after the addition of the isolated paraprotein to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from 10 healthy donors, in vitro. Expression of platelet von Willebrand factor (vWF) receptor glycoprotein (GP)Ib and platelet collagen receptor GPVI was determined by flow cytometry in the PRP of healthy donors before and after the addition of isolated paraprotein using the monoclonal antibodies, CD42b (for GPIb) and CD36 (for GPVI). Flowcytometry showed that expression of CD42b and CD36 positive cells was reduced after the addition of isolated paraprotein to PRP from healthy donors (p &lt; 0.001). These investigations demonstrated that paraprotein causes platelet dysfunction in patients with MG due to specific binding to the platelet vWF receptor GPIb and platelet collagen receptor GPVI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
research-article,100007,"Prognostic Significance of Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Treated by Radioimmunotherapy Using 131I-Rituximab Prognostic Significance of Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Treated by Radioimmunotherapy Using 131I-Rituximab Aims: It was the aim of this paper to identify prognostic factors in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, treated by radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with radioiodinated human/murine chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (131I-rituximab). Methods: Twenty-four patients were enrolled prospectively and were treated with unlabeled rituximab 70 mg and a therapeutic activity (median 7.3 GBq) of 131I-rituximab. Contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed before and after 1 month of RIT. Tumor sizes and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of scans were measured. Results: Four of the 24 patients survived. High SUVmax in a pretreatment scan was found to be related to poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, a large tumor size in a pretreatment scan was associated with poorer OS but not with progression-free survival (p &lt; 0.01 and p = 0.07, respectively). By multivariate analyses, a high SUVmax, a large tumor size in a pretreatment scan and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma histology were significantly associated with poorer OS [p = 0.04/hazard ratio (HR) = 3.54, p &lt; 0.01/HR = 5.52, and p = 0.02/HR = 3.38, respectively). Conclusion: SUVmax and tumor size determined by a pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT result as significant predictors of OS in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated by RIT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
research-article,100008,Inhibition of miR-21 Induces Biological and Behavioral Alterations in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Inhibition of miR-21 Induces Biological and Behavioral Alterations in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) has been ascribed a key role in many cellular processes, e.g. tumorigenesis via inhibition of target gene expression. However, its role in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is still unclear, and there are no in-depth studies on the relationship between miR-21 and the cellular phenotype of DLBCL. In this study, we investigated the expression and role of miR-21 in the regulation of cell biological processes in DLBCL. Firstly, miR-21 expression was evaluated in three DLBCL cell lines by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then, to determine the possible role of miR-21 in the biological and behavioral characteristics of DLBCL, we performed miR-21 knockdown by transfection with anti-miR-21. In addition, PDCD4 and PTEN were assessed by luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. Our study revealed that miR-21 was significantly upregulated in activated B-cell-like DLBCL cells compared to germinal center-like DLBCL cells. We demonstrated that inhibition of miR-21 induced suppression of proliferation and invasion, as well as increased apoptosis in DLBCL. Moreover, knockdown of miR-21 increased PDCD4 and PTEN expression at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. In conclusion, miR-21 can regulate proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, and thus it has a potential therapeutic application in DLBCL.
meta-analysis,100009,"Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation for Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation for Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) comprises a heterogeneous group of mature T-cell tumors with a poor prognosis; allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) may offer a potential way of cure for these patients though the optimal type and timing of transplantation remain to be defined. We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis examining the efficacy and safety of allo-SCT for PTCL. The pooled 3-year overall survival (OS) of PTCL patients treated with allo-SCT was 49.6% (95% confidence interval, CI: 41.7-57.5%). A meta-analysis of 3-year OS in allo-SCT and autologous SCT (auto-SCT) showed no statistical difference. The rates of pooled acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; grade 2/4) and chronic GVHD were 26.7% (95% CI: 21.4-32.9%) and 29.9% (95% CI: 24.3-36.1%), respectively. The pooled 100-day treatment-related mortality was 24.2% (95% CI: 17.2-33.0%). Of the total study patients (n = 299), 48.5% were reported dead after allo-hematopoietic SCT, with disease progression as the first cause of death in PTCL patients. Although most studies included were retrospective and their sample size was small, existing data suggested that the group of PTCL patients receiving allo-SCT was to a great degree homogeneous regarding OS, mortality without relapse, death rate and the incidence of GVHD. The most common cause of death was disease progression. The present data did not show a difference in OS between allo- and auto-SCT in PTCL patients, but large prospective studies are needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of allo-SCT in the treatment of PTCL patients. © 2014 S.

systematic-review,100010,Adolescents and Young Adults with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Slipping between the Cracks Adolescents and Young Adults with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Slipping between the Cracks Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer have inferior survival as compared to children. The reasons for this survival gap are multifactorial and related to psychosocial aspects, patient- and disease-related biological characteristics as well as to therapeutic approaches within this age span. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) comprises approximately 7% of cancer among AYAs, and patient allocation and therapy vary between health systems. In this systematic review we focus on the current biological and clinical knowledge relevant to AYAs with NHL applying these data to the clinical approach and practice. Data are insufficient to recommend a pediatric or an adult approach for AYAs with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Dose-adjusted EPOCH-R seems to be a promising, radiation-free approach for AYAs with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Limitations in data interpretation include the lack of interventional trials tailored specifically for the AYA population and the lack of uniform criteria for staging and response assessment in pediatric and adult trials.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meta-analysis,100011,"Insights into the All-trans-Retinoic Acid and Arsenic Trioxide Combination Treatment for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: A Meta-Analysis Insights into the All-trans-Retinoic Acid and Arsenic Trioxide Combination Treatment for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: A Meta-Analysis Background: This study aimed to compare the curative effects of the combination therapy of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO, As2O3) with ATRA monotherapy on newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Methods: The studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ChinaInfo and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from the inception to June 20, 2014. Thereafter, the eligible studies were selected based on the predefined criteria, and the literature quality was assessed. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.2 software. The pooled effect size was relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 8 studies containing 480 cases were included, among which 264 were assigned to the ATRA + ATO group and the other 216 to the ATRA group. The meta-analysis showed that ATRA + ATO combination therapy significantly improved the complete remission (CR) rate (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03-1.16, p = 0.004), decreased the early mortality rate (RR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.20-0.9, p = 0.03) and relapse rate (RR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.42, p &lt; 0.0001), but increased the high risk of liver dysfunction (RR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.72-3.41, p &lt; 0.00001), comparing with ATRA monotherapy. Conclusions: The ATRA + ATO combination therapy may be more effective for newly diagnosed APL with a higher CR rate but lower early mortality rate and relapse rate. However, the risks of liver damage should be of concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
research-article,100012,Apoptosis-Related Gene Expression Profile in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients after Imatinib Mesylate and Dasatinib Therapy Apoptosis-Related Gene Expression Profile in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients after Imatinib Mesylate and Dasatinib Therapy Background/Aims: We investigated the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the expression of apoptosis-related genes (BCL-2 and death receptor family members) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 32 healthy subjects and 26 CML patients were evaluated before and after treatment with imatinib mesylate (IM) and dasatinib (DAS) by quantitative PCR. Results: Anti-apoptotic genes (c-FLIP and MCL-1) were overexpressed and the pro-apoptotic BIK was reduced in CML patients. Expression of BMF, A1, c-FLIP, MCL-1, CIAP-2 and CIAP-1 was modulated by DAS. In IM-resistant patients, expression of A1, c-FLIP, CIAP-1 and MCL-1 was upregulated, and BCL-2, CIAP-2, BAK, BAX, BIK and FASL expression was downregulated. Conclusion: Taken together, our results point out that, in CML, DAS interferes with the apoptotic machinery regulation. In addition, the data suggest that apoptosis-related gene expression profiles are associated with primary resistance to IM.
meta-analysis,100013,"Association of MDM2 Polymorphism with Risk and Prognosis of Leukemia: A Meta-Analysis Association of MDM2 Polymorphism with Risk and Prognosis of Leukemia: A Meta-Analysis Objective: In this study, we performed an updated meta-analysis by summarizing all available relevant association studies to evaluate whether the murine double minute-2 (MDM2) T309G polymorphism is associated with risk of leukemia and to determine its prognostic effect. Material and Methods: Studies published in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register were searched till June 2014 using the search terms ‘MDM2', ‘polymorphism' and ‘leukemia'. Results: Eleven studies were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 2,478 patients accrued. There were 8 studies providing data on single nucleotide polymorphism at position 309 (SNP309) and risk of leukemia and 7 studies providing data on SNP309 and overall survival. Our analysis showed that patients having G/G mutations had a significantly higher risk of developing leukemia (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.56-2.31, p &lt; 0.00001), while the association between G/T and leukemia was not significant (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96-1.45, p = 0.11). In addition, SNP309 was not significantly associated with patient survival (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.79-2.13, p = 0.31). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed that the MDM2 T309G variation, especially homozygous G/G, might be associated with an increased risk of leukemia. Additional studies are needed to confirm the findings as well as to understand the underlying mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meta-analysis,100014,"The Role of Consolidative Radiotherapy after a Complete Response to Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in the Rituximab Era: Results from a Systematic Review with a Meta-Analysis The Role of Consolidative Radiotherapy after a Complete Response to Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in the Rituximab Era: Results from a Systematic Review with a Meta-Analysis Background: The current standard therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (RCHOP). The role of radiotherapy (RT) after complete response (CR) to RCHOP in patients with DLBCL remains unclear. This systematic review with a meta-analysis is an attempt to evaluate this role. Methods: Studies that evaluated RT versus no-RT after CR to RCHOP for DLBCL patients were searched in databases. Hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 4 qualified retrospective studies (633 patients) were included in this review. The results suggested that RT improved overall survival (OS; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.77) and progression-free/event-free survival (PFS/EFS; HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.50) in all patients compared with no-RT. In a subgroup analysis of patients with stage III-IV DLBCL, RT improved PFS/EFS (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.51) and local control (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.44), with a trend of improving OS (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12-1.05). Conclusion: Consolidation RT could significantly improve outcomes of DLBCL patients who achieved a CR to RCHOP. However, the significance of these results was limited by these retrospective data. Further investigation of the role of consolidation RT in the rituximab era is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
systematic-review,100015,Molecular Characteristics and Clinical Significance of 12 Fusion Genes in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: A Systematic Review Molecular Characteristics and Clinical Significance of 12 Fusion Genes in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: A Systematic Review Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the generation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid (RA) receptor α (PML-RARα) fusion gene. PML-RARα is the central leukemia-initiating event in APL and is directly targeted by all-trans-RA (ATRA) as well as arsenic. In classic APL harboring PML-RARα transcripts, more than 90% of patients can achieve complete remission when treated with ATRA combined with arsenic trioxide chemotherapy. In the last 20 years, more than 10 variant fusion genes have been found and identified in APL patients. These variant APL cases present different clinical phenotypes and treatment outcomes. All variant APL cases show a similar breakpoint within the RARα gene, whereas its partner genes are variable. These fusion proteins have the ability to repress rather than activate retinoic targets. These chimeric proteins also possess different molecular characteristics, thereby resulting in variable sensitivities to ATRA and clinical outcomes. In this review, we comprehensively analyze various rearrangements in variant APL cases that have been reported in the literature as well as the molecular characteristics and functions of the fusion proteins derived from different RARα partner genes and their clinical implications.,,,,,,,,,,,
meta-analysis,100016,"Association between Transfusion Status and Overall Survival in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis Association between Transfusion Status and Overall Survival in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis Introduction: Multiple studies show that transfusion independence (TI) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has a positive impact on overall survival (OS). To assess this, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between TI and OS in patients with MDS was conducted (PROSPERO ID: CRD42014007264). Methods: Comprehensive searches of 5 key bibliographic databases were conducted and supplemented with additional search techniques. Included were studies that had recruited adults aged &gt;18 years with MDS and had examined the impact of transfusion status on OS. Results: Fifty-five studies (89 citations) were included. The vast majority reported a statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) for OS in favor of TI patients or in patients who acquired TI after treatment. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Patients classed as TI at baseline showed a 59% decrease in the risk of death compared with transfusion-dependent (TD) patients [HR 0.41; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.29-0.56], and this effect did not appear to interact significantly with illness severity (interaction coefficient HR 1.38; 95% CrI 0.62-3.41). A meta-analysis of studies where patients acquired TI was not possible, but those studies consistently reported a survival benefit for those who acquired TI. Conclusion: The findings revealed a 59% pooled reduction in mortality among TI patients when compared with TD patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
case-report,100017,Dasatinib-Induced T-Cell-Mediated Colitis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature Dasatinib-Induced T-Cell-Mediated Colitis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature Dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of the altered tyrosine kinase activity in disease states associated with BCR/ABL1. This agent has been shown to exhibit broad off-target kinase inhibition and immunomodulating properties. These effects may be responsible for dasatinib's unique side effects including a distinctive form of hemorrhagic colitis. We report a case of hemorrhagic colitis associated with dasatinib use in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Colon biopsies at the time of symptomatic colitis confirmed CD3+CD8+ T cell infiltration. The process rapidly resolved following drug discontinuation, but relapsed when rechallenged with a reduced dose of dasatinib. Colitis did not recur when the patient was treated with an alternative agent. A literature review of prior cases involving dasatinib-induced T-cell mediated colitis provides insight into commonalities that may facilitate the recognition and management of this entity. Most incidences occurred after a 3-month drug exposure and may be accompanied by large granular lymphocytes. The process uniformly resolves within a few days following drug discontinuation and will generally recur in a shorter period of time if the drug is reintroduced. Most patients will require an alternative agent, although select patients could be continued on dasatinib if other options are limited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
systematic-review,100018,"Outcome Comparison of Allogeneic versus Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Transformed Low-Grade Lymphoid Malignancies: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis of Comparative Studies Outcome Comparison of Allogeneic versus Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Transformed Low-Grade Lymphoid Malignancies: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis of Comparative Studies Background: Some patients with low-grade lymphoid malignancies develop transformed disease, requiring stem cell transplantation (SCT). SCT outcomes in transformed low-grade lymphoid malignancies may differ from those of nontransformed disease or other aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We conducted a pooled analysis of the clinical outcomes of allogeneic versus high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous SCT in adult patients with transformed low-grade lymphoid malignancies. Methods: A PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane search yielded 4 comparative studies reporting allogeneic versus HDT with autologous SCT outcomes in adults (age ≥18) with transformed low-grade lymphoid malignancies, including follicular, chronic/small lymphocytic, and marginal zone lymphoma. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Rates for overall survival (OS) were 51.0 versus 69.5% (RR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.19-2.02, p = 0.001), rates of relapse were 37.3 versus 35.3% (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.70-1.55, p = 0.84), and rates of transplant-related mortality (TRM) were 33.3 versus 7.2% (RR = 4.52, 95% CI 2.75-7.43, p &lt; 0.00001) for allogeneic versus autologous SCT. Previous rituximab treatment, reduced intensity conditioning regimen prior to SCT, or original pathology had no prognostic impact. Conclusion: HDT followed by autologous SCT was associated with lower TRM and a better OS, but there was no difference in relapse versus allogeneic SCT. Autologous SCT may be the better therapeutic option, considering the second chance of allogeneic SCT in the case of relapse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
