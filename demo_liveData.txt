,900000,Sympathetic Activity and Blood Pressure Pattern in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Hypertensives Sympathetic Activity and Blood Pressure Pattern in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Hypertensives To study the potential role of sympathetic activity in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and to analyze its relationship with 24-hour blood pressure pattern, plasma catecholamines and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were evaluated in 30 ADPKD hypertensive patients (of which 17 without and 13 with renal failure) and in 50 essential hypertensives. The groups were matched for sex, body mass index, known duration of hypertension, and clinic blood pressure. Plasma catecholamines, determined in resting position, were higher in ADPKD patients without renal failure than in essential hypertensives. Nighttime diastolic blood pressure was higher and the percentage day-night difference in mean blood pressure was lower in hypertensives with ADPKD compared to patients with essential hypertension. Blood pressure was significantly correlated with plasma noradrenaline in ADPKD patients, independently of renal function. No significant differences were observed between ADPKD patients with and without renal failure, with respect to plasma catecholamines, 24-hour daytime and nighttime ambulatory blood pressures and the percentage day-night difference in mean blood pressure.,,
,900001,Study of Effect of Optimization of Dialysis and Protein Intake on Neuromuscular Function in Patients under Maintenance Hemodialysis Treatment Study of Effect of Optimization of Dialysis and Protein Intake on Neuromuscular Function in Patients under Maintenance Hemodialysis Treatment This study was carried out on 22 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Among them, 20 patients were males and 2 were females, their age ranged from 12 to 50 years. Initially, the patients were assessed clinically and by laboratory investigations and their dialysis was assessed by studying their urea kinetic modeling following the nomographic approach for calculating their Kt/V values. Their nutrition was assessed by measuring skin folds, midarm circumference, laboratory parameters and by calculating the normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). Also their neuromuscular functions were assessed by clinical examination and neurophysiologic study. Dialysis dose was readjusted to achieve a target Kt/V value of 1.3 for patients on 3 times weekly dialysis and 1.6 for patients on twice weekly dialysis. Also, their nutrition was reviewed to achieve nPCR 1.2 g/kg/day and caloric intake 30–40 kcal/kg/day through diet manipulation and support. The patients were assessed finally after 3 months on targeted dialysis and nutrition by thorough clinical, laboratory and neuromuscular assessment.Analysis of neurophysiologic data showed significant improvement in electromyography. Furthermore, fatigue test showed significant (p = 0.002) decreases in muscle fatigue after optimization of dialysis dose and patients’ nutrition.From this study, we may conclude that in dialysis patients, even when asymptomatic and clinically stable, neurologic deficits do exist and using area kinetic modeling to improve dialysis and patients’ nutrition is valuable in improving their neuromuscular functions.
,900002,"Effect of Intravenous Calcitriol on Cardiac Systolic and Diastolic Function in Patients on Hemodialysis Effect of Intravenous Calcitriol on Cardiac Systolic and Diastolic Function in Patients on Hemodialysis The systolic and diastolic function of the heart of hemodialysis (HD) patients and the effect of intravenous vitamin D therapy on cardiac function was studied by Doppler and digitized M-mode echocardiography in 10 HD patients before and after 3–4.5 months of calcitriol therapy. Calcitriol was administered intravenously 1–3 times a week at a dose of 1–2 µg after the dialysis sessions. Ten age- and sex-matched healthy controls were also examined echocardiographically. Before calcitriol therapy cardiac wall thicknesses (interventricular septum, posterior wall) and left ventricle (LV) dimensions (end diastolic, end systolic) were greater, and LV diastolic (peak late diastolic velocity, peak early diastolic velocity/peak late diastolic velocity ratio, isovolumic relaxation time) and systolic (fractional shortening) function was impaired in HD patients as compared to controls. The LV posterior wall thickness was related to plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH; r = 0.70, p = 0.01) in the patients. Calcitriol therapy raised serum ionized Ca from 1.23±0.04 to 1.33 ± 0.04 mmol/l and reduced PTH from 41.1±10.7 to 34.2±11.7 pmol/l (29±11%). Calcitriol therapy did not cause any significant changes in cardiac function in the whole patient group. However, in a subgroup of 5 patients with severe but controllable hyperparathyroidism (PTH &gt;3 times upper normal margin) the LV dimensions and systolic function improved (LV end systolic dimension from 39.0 ± 4.0 to 31.3 ± 2.9 mm, p = 0.03; LV end diastolic dimension from 57.7 ± 3.1 to 53.4 ± 3.0 mm, p = 0.06; fractional shortening from 33 ± 4 to 42 ± 3%, p = 0.03). The diastolic indices improved also, but not significantly. In conclusion, left ventricle hypertrophy and systolic and diastolic dysfunction was observed in HD patients. Intravenous calcitriol therapy improved cardiac function in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.",,,,,,,,,,,
